I am a software engineer that currently specializes in all things Javascript related: React, Gatsby, Node, Typescript, ES6, Redux, RxJs, Intern, Jest, npm, Enzyme, Sinon, Webpack, and more.

To me, the heart and soul of programming is in how well you can solve problems using the tools that you have at your disposal. The ability to quickly pick up a new tool or framework is extremely important in the rapidly changing ecosystem of modern Javascript development.

Feel free to have a look through my projects and repositories listed here.

I am also a lover of all types of music, a guitar player, an avid gamer, an above-average bowler, and an amateur (but passionate) snowboarder.

I love to make healthy, home-made meals, go jogging, and last but not least, tinker with anything that is broken to try and figure out how it works and fix it.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me via email or social media, as listed to the left.
